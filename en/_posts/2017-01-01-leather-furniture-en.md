The leather is sensitive material. After long time using the leather begins to dry and brake. Our advice is to keep the leather furnitures at least 2 meters away from sun light and any source of heat. The daily cleaning includes wiping with soft and wet towel.
It is good once a month to clean basically the leather furnitures at home. For this purpose you need to mix 1/4 cup of vinegar and 1/2 cup of water, that you ust wipe the furnute with. After that wipe with leather soap, to clean and remove the smell. Finally you need to wipe out with dry soft towel.
