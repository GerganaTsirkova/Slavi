It is good to keep the sofas at home away from all sources of heat and sun light, to prevent the fading of the furniture. It is good to clean those furniture once a week with vacuum cleaner. The pillows must be dust regularly. The pillow covers must be washed at least once a month.

When it comes to cleaning spots over the furniture, the best practice is to wipe out immediately the spots. It is good to wash the sofas once a few months with proper laundry detergent.
Taking care of your furniture lasts their life, and don't forget the purity is health.
