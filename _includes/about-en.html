    <h2>Our achievements</h2>
    <p>We are dedicated to our work and we do our best to satisfy our clients!</p>
    <p>One of the undeniable proovments for the quality of our work is the "15-th national BMW fair" in 2016</p>
    <p>The first place won gives us the motivation to keep going. For the winner, we did full renovation of the leather interior and the textile elements interior - car seats, steering wheel, car crusts, dashboard, ceiling and carpet floor. The client arrived
        specially from Varna, because he wanted a professional renovation and keep the authentic look of the car. The car had a lot of defects, some of them standard for the beige leather interior, like worn out car door holders. The car seats were partly
        worn out with scratches, under the luxury armrest there were scratches and another defects. Because of all the defects, the car looked very old and worn out, but we knew that this interior will be completely renovated after our work. In these
        situations lot of owners prefer to upholstery with synthetic leather. This is wrong because they don’t know that the original leather with its original stitches can be renovated at 100%. After 4 days work the team of “interior Auto", restored
        completely the whole car interior. At the end we polished the mahogany and the chrome elements of the interior.
